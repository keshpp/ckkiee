    <p style="color: aliceblue;" align="center" > 1. First chop some dry fruits. I have used cashews, pistachios 
        and raisins. <br> If you prefer, you can add nuts like almonds, walnuts, pecans, pinenuts etc. <br> Instead of raisins
         you can dried apricot. <br> These nuts give a nice crunch in the gooey melted chocolate inside the sandwiches. <br> 
         2. Take the bread slices. Slice the edges if you want. <br>
         Spread some softened butter on each slice. You can use salted or unsalted butter.
         Wheat bread, multigrain bread or Brown bread or White bread or Sandwich bread are <br> all great options to make these sandwiches. <br>
         But just ensure that your bread has a soft and light crumb. <br> You can also use 1 to 2 day old bread that has been refrigerated. <br>
         3. Now place the choco chips evenly on the bread slices. <br>
          Keep in mind not to add too much as then the chocolate melts <br>
         and oozes out of the bread while grilling and toasting. <br>

         Instead of choco chips, you can use any type of baking or cooking chocolate <br>
          like sweet or semi-sweet chocolate or milk chocolate. <br>
         
         Depending upon the size of the bread add the required amount of chocolate chips. <br>
          Here I have used smaller-sized bread. <br>
